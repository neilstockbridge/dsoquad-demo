Examples of using the features of the DSO Quad BIOS and MCU.

The [font_perf experiment](blob/master/experiments1/experiments/font_perf.c) includes a text renderer that is over 3&times; as fast as the BIOS renderer using the same glyphs.

`support/` is stuff that's essential to get any application running.  `lib/` is reusable parts.
