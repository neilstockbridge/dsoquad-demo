 
This application installs to the first 4K of application slot 3 ( page 16) and presents a simple UI to select another page to launch.  Mini-applications can then be installed in pages 17 to 23 while still leaving app slots 1, 2 and 4 available for 32K applications.

It can also be used to level your flash wear during development by flashing smaller applications to areas of the flash that don't include the first 4K of app slots 1 to 4, which could otherwise reach their 10,000 erase-cycle limit.
